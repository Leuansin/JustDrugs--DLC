Â¡Hi! If you're reading this, it means that you are interested in the source code of my mod!

Well, since i took inspiration from Skyler's Mod, i can't really be hypocrite and not offer an open source mod.

So, the code is open-source 100%, you can feel free to create sub-mods taking this one as base.
It is pretty organized, since i like to code that way.
Btw, the comments are going to be in spanish, since im Chilean.

I've already made 6 mods to my patreon supporters, so if you want a special mod, with a unique idea, dont be afraid to contact me.
